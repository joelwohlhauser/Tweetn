# A Social Network made with PHP

Tweeten is a Twitter clone which was programmed with PHP only. With Tweetn you can create posts, follow other people and send private messages. For the communication between two users public and private keys are used and the messages are encrypted with bcrypt. 

This project was a school project and **will not be further developed**.

### Setup

1. Run the `database/databaseSetup.sql` script in your local oder live MySQL environment
2. Specify the database properties in the `database/functions.php` file
3. Start your local server or upload the files to a real web server
